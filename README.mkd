# PowerGrASP
The Python Powergraph analysis tool, based on Answer Set Programming solving and formal concept analysis.

## Requirements
Needs [python-gringo module](https://github.com/lxsli/python-gringo).
Unfortunately, you will need to compile clingo yourself, for includes the python support. (and eventually the thread support, for a faster compression)
This can be a pain, but there is a little help (in french, infortunately) given by *doc/help.mkd*.

## Basic use
PowerGrASP can be used as a script:

    python2 powergrasp --graph-data=human_proteom.lp --output-file=for_cytoscape.bbl

Or can be embedded in any python program:

    import powergrasp

    with open('human_proteom.lp') as fin, open('for_cytoscape.bbl', 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(powergrasp.compress(fin.read()))

## Help & Details
The compression is configurable through command line arguments or compress function parameters.
Used ASP source code can be changed, interactive mode can be set,â€¦ Please look at help and docstring:

    # in terminal
    python2 powergrasp --help
    # in python
    help(powergrasp)
