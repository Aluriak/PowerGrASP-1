% Input:
%       - ccedge(cc,X,Y): there exists an edge between X and Y in the
%                         subgraph corresponding to connected component cc
%       - membercc(cc,Y): Y is a member of cc, but not its root.
%       - covered(X,Y): edge(X,Y) is already covered.
%       - lowbound: exits iff the maxlowerbound must be computed
%       - include_block(k,B,p(cc,k,T)): block B contains set T of newconcept.
%       - block(k,B,X): block B contains X.
%       - include_powernode(cc,K1,T1,K2,T2): powernode K1,T1 contains K2,T2.
% Output:
%       - oedge(X,Y): there exits a usable edge between X and Y with X<Y
%       - membercc(Y): Y is a member of cc, and is used by oedge
%       - maxlowerbound(S): the maximal score lower bound is S
%       - degree(X,D): node X have a degree of D (=there is D nodes linked to X)
