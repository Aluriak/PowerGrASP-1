% Constants:
%       - cc: treated connected component. (cc/1 gives existing cc)
%       -  k: current step of treatment (first step is 1)
% Input:
%       - oedge(X,Y): there exist an oriented edge linking X and Y in cc.
%       - membercc(Y): Y is a member of cc.
% Output:
%       - newconcept(cc,k,T,X): X is the member of the set T in the concept cc at step k.
%       - star(cc,k,T): set T of concept is a star.

% share at least one neighbor

% Choice of elements in part 2

% An element in a set can't be in the other set.
:- newconcept(cc,k,1,X) ; newconcept(cc,k,2,X).

% Impossible element in a concept
%  a node is impossible if not linked to some node of other part
imp(k,3-T,X):- membercc(X); newconcept(cc,k,T,Y) ; not inter(X,Y) ; not inter(Y,X).
%  a node is impossible if not linked2 to some node of the same part
imp(k,T,X):- membercc(X); newconcept(cc,k,T,Y) ; not linked2(X,Y); X!=Y.
% Consistency ; no impossible element can be added to the concept
:- imp(k,T,Y); newconcept(cc,k,T,Y).
