% Perform post-processing of the data at each steps.
%  its not a stand alone program, but a set of rules that needs to be grounded with
%  find best clique and find best biclique program
%  the post processing consist of rules shared by cliques and bicliques,
%  like parent block or include block rules, and the associated constraints.
%
%  more important : postprocessing is based on atoms newconcept, clique and star
%  produced (or not) by findbestbiclique and findbestclique.
%  The maximal lowerbound optimization of concept score is performed by postprocessing.

%  the score is defined as the upperbound (maximal edge cover) minus edge cover.
%  bigger is the edge cover, smaller is the score.

% clique: create an edge to powernode itself / don't need to create two powernodes

% star: link directly the alone node to the second powernode
