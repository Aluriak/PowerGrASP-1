Extract the connected components of the graph
Input:
  	- edge(X,Y): there exists an edge between X and Y in the graph.
Output:
        - connectedpath(X,Y): there exists a path from X to Y, X<Y.
        - cc(CC): CC is the minimal element of a connected component.
        - ccedge(CC,X,Y): there exists an edge between X and Y in CC.
